/*
long zfunction(long param)
Clear from the 20th to 27th bits (counting left to right, the leftmost bit is the 0th bit), 
shift the parameter param by 8 bits to the left, and then fill the rightmost 8 bits with 1s. 
For example, the input parameter 0xaabbccdd should generate a return value of 0xbbc00dff. 
You can assume that the size of long is 4 bytes. The code for this function should be entirely written in x86 assembly. 
You should not use inline assembly (i.e., do not use asm("...")). To investigate the assembly code generated by 
the compiler, you can use the tool objdump -d <___ .o> to disassemble an object file. The object files reside in 
the /compile directory within the main Xinu directory. You can also see some of the *.S files in the /sys directory for reference. 
(Tips: please check out the readings above before doing this question.)
